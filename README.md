# TIP-Calculator

This is a small webApp I created to practice my JavaScript skills and also avoid
those awkward moment of not knowing how much to tip when going out with friends. 

I want to also focus on using GRID css structure on this app instead of Flexbox
which I have been getting use to for the past few days.


### What I learned
- Do not add the background color to *{}, add it to body{} instead
- When you want to center a div, you want to change the property of its parent




ISSUE: 
- somehow forgot how to add a text inside a section
