# TIP-Calculator

This is a small webApp I created to practice my JavaScript skills and also avoid
those awkward moment of not knowing how much to tip when going out with friends. 

I want to also focus on using GRID css structure on this app instead of Flexbox
which I have been getting use to for the past few days.


### What I learned





ISSUE: 





TODO: 
- [] Focus on creating the html and css structure
- [] Learn how to add JavaScript implementation
- [] UI active state
